### Cornelia feedback

- Title, Authors 
- (15%) Motivation: the team described what FPL is (nice!). Literature review provided as well (this is very nice as well). Made it very clear from the very beginning that they run 8 model architectures and used MSE/MAE as a metric to evaluate performance (nice!) The team also provides an overview of preliminary results (nice!).
- (15%) Data: Size of data clearly identified, as well as features available in the data. Itâ€™s not very clear what the outcome variable is.
- (15%) Modeling: Baseline model (always predict total points). Focused on five of the models presented. LR: I like that the team also plotted the baseline results as a reference point. LSTM: not so great for this data. FFNN: the model is underfitting. KNN: included cross-validation, RF results included as well. I like that the team provided a subgroup analysis as well (avg predicted points by team, by gameweek, by position - nice!)
- (30%) Experiments: LR: yes, LSTM: yes, FFNN: yes, 
- (10%) Conclusions: Pointed out what is the best model relevant to baseline (nice!). Identified what are the types of players for which the RF model performed best. Identified future areas for improvement (e.g., cost efficiency, focus on top 50 players). 
- (15%) Code submission: the code is very well organized and well commented. 
- General comment: Some slides are very wordy (it can be hard to both listen and read). Otherwise, a very good work team and thanks for coming to OH to share your journey working on this project.
- Contributions: TBD
